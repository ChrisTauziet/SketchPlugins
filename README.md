Handy is a plugin that makes working with guides easier in Sketch. It includes two plugins currently:
* Add Guide (cmd shift option g): lets you add a vertical or horizontal guide at any point, for example 'v,100' adds a vertical guide at 100px. You can also pass multiple, space-separated values ('v,100 h,200').
* Remove Guides (cmd shift option r): removes all guides across your artboards.

Note you need Rulers turned on (Control R) to see guides
