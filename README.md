## Handy
Makes adding and removing guides a cinch. Requires an artboard and rulers to be visible.

You can add guides one at a time with `orientation,position` syntax, or multiple guides as space-separated values.

For example, `v,100` will create a vertical guide at 100px. `v,200 h,200` will create vertical and horizontal guides at 200px. You get the idea.
